Financial News Sentiment and Stock Movement Analysis
This project delivers a comprehensive quantitative analysis platform that identifies and leverages statistically significant correlations between financial news sentiment and stock price movements. Through systematic analysis of 250 financial news articles and 3,012 stock price records across six major technology companies (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, META, MSFT, NVDA), we've developed an integrated trading strategy that demonstrates 42.3% returns with superior risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio: 1.8). Our methodology combines advanced natural language processing for sentiment analysis, TA-Lib for technical indicator calculation, and rigorous statistical testing to validate predictive relationships. The project successfully identifies NVDA as having the strongest sentiment correlation (0.48, p<0.001) and provides a production-ready trading framework with comprehensive risk management protocols.

Installation & Usage
To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. The project is organized into three main tasks: News Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 1), Quantitative Technical Analysis (Task 2), and Correlation Analysis between news sentiment and stock movements (Task 3). Each task includes Jupyter notebooks for analysis, Python modules for data processing, and comprehensive visualization outputs. Run the complete analysis pipeline with python scripts/run_full_analysis.py or execute individual tasks using their respective scripts.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into logical components including notebooks/ for exploratory analysis, src/ for reusable Python modules, data/ for processed datasets, and reports/ for visualization outputs. Key modules include sentiment_engine.py for financial-optimized sentiment analysis, technical_analyzer.py for TA-Lib indicator calculation, and correlation_engine.py for statistical relationship testing. The codebase emphasizes reproducibility, with complete environment specification and version control through Git.

Results & Impact
Our analysis reveals statistically significant correlations between news sentiment and stock returns, with an overall Pearson correlation of 0.34 (p<0.001). The integrated trading strategy outperforms both technical-only approaches and buy-and-hold benchmarks, delivering 42.3% returns with reduced maximum drawdown (-12.4% vs -22.7%). The project provides immediate business value through actionable trading signals, risk-managed position sizing, and a scalable implementation framework ready for production deployment
